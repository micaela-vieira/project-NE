Author: Mathias Plüss
Abstract: It’s getting more and more difficult for experts to get their arguments across to a broad public. We investigate why, and offer six suggestions for improving things.

Experts were never really that popular. People don’t like to be told what’s best for them, and anyone who insists on accuracy is soon labelled a know-it-all. Experts early on had to learn to live with ridicule: they might know a lot about their own subject, so it went, but they didn’t have a clue about ‘real life’. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce mocked “specialists who know everything about something and nothing about anything else”.
Tom Nichols is a professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport. He says he’s long had to get used to the fact that most people don’t like professors. Nevertheless, he thinks things have still changed from how they used to be. Back in the 1960s and ’70s, “most Americans assumed that the same people who put a man on the moon were probably right about most other important things”. But today, people devoid of any specialist knowledge are becoming convinced that they know better than the experts. “I don’t have a problem with people being sceptical – that’s actually a good thing”, says Nichols. “What’s bad is that people have lost all respect. We’re now being challenged aggressively”.
