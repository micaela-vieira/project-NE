Teleportation and travelling forwards through time may be possible through wormholes, the bipolar black holes that link different regions of the universe.
This is the conclusion drawn from a model created by Kyriakos Papadodimas<annotation class="PERSON"> of CERN<annotation class="ORG"> and Rik van Breukelen<annotation class="PERSON"> of the University of Geneva<annotation class="ORG">.
Instantaneous travel and travel into the future would become possible by travelling through a wormhole, and this completely free of the time dilation predicted by Einstein<annotation class="PERSON">’s theory of relativity.
It is, however, “a purely theoretical model that would only apply to an elementary particle, such as a photon”, adds van Breukelen<annotation class="PERSON">.
With their model, the physicists have developed a new category of worm hole and describe – in theoretical terms – how information stored on a particle (e.g., using its electrical charge) could travel instantaneously to another part of space-time.
“Wormholes are today<annotation class="DATE"> still only theories”, says van Breukelen<annotation class="PERSON">.
“But, in principal, it would be possible to create an artificial black hole, by using a particle accelerator, for example, although it would have to be a billion kilometres<annotation class="QUANTITY"> long, the same distance the Earth<annotation class="LOC"> travels around the sun in a year<annotation class="DATE">.
So it’s an idea that’s theoretically possible, but also many millennia ahead of its time”.
Investigation into the phenomenon is advancing on two<annotation class="CARDINAL"> separate tracks: the Anti-de Sitter space (AdSn), based on a quantum theory of gravitation, and the conformal field theory (CFT), a model of elementary particles that treats them as excitations of the fields of fundamental forces.
This work remains abstract in nature.
There’s still a long way to go before computers can simulate the behaviour of particles travelling through a worm hole.
“That will require quantum computers, which may not see the light of day for another 15 years<annotation class="DATE">.
Even then, we’re still talking simulations, but it beats waiting 2,000 years<annotation class="DATE">”, says van Breukelen<annotation class="PERSON">.
