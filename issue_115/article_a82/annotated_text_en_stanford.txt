Peer-review practice in numbers
The recipe for highly ranked universities
A study based on the Leiden Ranking of universities<annotation class="ORG"> has shown that large universities systematically over-perform in citation performance as well as in international and university/industry co-publications.
It surmises that they benefit from economies of scale and greater visibility.
Surprisingly, the institution’s age and the population size of the surrounding metropolitan area slightly decrease performance.
Purely technical universities enjoy a better ranking.
“No single country excels in all three<annotation class="CARDINAL"> dimensions of citation impact, internationalization, and industry involvement”, write the authors, “with the possible exception of Switzerland<annotation class="GPE">”.

Nutrition, sports, palaeontology, meditation practices, library sciences and Indonesia<annotation class="GPE">-based research now have dedicated platforms for publishing preprints, all based on the OSF<annotation class="ORG"> platform.
In percent
17%<annotation class="PERCENT">: the proportion of foreign students in Swiss<annotation class="NORP"> universities, three<annotation class="CARDINAL"> times the OECD<annotation class="ORG"> average.
73%<annotation class="PERCENT">: the proportion of a random sample of 155<annotation class="CARDINAL"> ERC<annotation class="ORG"> projects having made “breakthroughs or major scientific advances”.
17%<annotation class="PERCENT">: the decrease in the student evaluation grades received by female university teachers in economics compared to male staff, despite the same teaching Quality.
