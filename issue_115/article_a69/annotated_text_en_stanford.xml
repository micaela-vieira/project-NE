In an email today<annotation class="DATE"/>, the International Journal of Research on Neuroscience<annotation class="ORG"/> has invited me to submit an article in order to make the results of my “groundbreaking” research accessible to a broad readership.
Open access, of course.
In the eyes of the journal’s editors, I’m an “esteemed researcher” and a “leader in the field”, even though I’ve never actually done any research in the neurosciences.
It’s obvious that we’re dealing here with a ‘predatory journal’ employing an exploitative open-access publication model.
It charges a fee to publish articles, though without any serious peer review or editorial support by competent editors.
Today<annotation class="DATE"/>, there are some 8,000<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> such fraudulent ‘journals’ across the world, and they produce more than 400,000<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> articles every year.
They are not just a nuisance in your inbox, but a threat to scientific integrity and to the open-access publication model that the SNSF<annotation class="ORG"/> and other funding institutions are trying to promote.
Contrary to popular opinion, these journals are not just a problem in Africa<annotation class="LOC"/>, China<annotation class="GPE"/> or India<annotation class="GPE"/>.
A new study in Nature<annotation class="ORG"/> has investigated almost 2,000<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> biomedical articles from over 200<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> predatory journals, and it turns out that roughly a quarter<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> of the corresponding authors are from the USA<annotation class="GPE"/> and other Western<annotation class="NORP"/> countries.
The funding agencies mentioned most often are the National Institutes of Health<annotation class="ORG"/> (NIH<annotation class="ORG"/>).
The authors of this study are calling for research funding institutions to refrain from giving any money for publishing in such fraudulent journals.
They also believe that the publication lists of funding applicants should not include any articles published there.
Are Switzerland<annotation class="GPE"/> and the SNSF<annotation class="ORG"/> also affected?
Almost certainly.
For this reason, we are examining our own data to this end, and we will also study the publicly accessible data contained in the abovementioned study.
The SNSF<annotation class="ORG"/> is in a position to keep a check on such matters, and is keen to do so.
But in my opinion, the responsibility lies primarily with the authors, who ought to recognise and avoid such predatory journals.
One<annotation class="CARDINAL"/> important resource in this regard is the website thinkchecksubmit.org, which provides a checklist to help less experienced researchers choose suitable, trustworthy journals for their articles.
You too can help to make this initiative better known: download their poster, and put it on the notice board of your break room.
Matthias Egger<annotation class="PERSON"/> is the President of the National Research Council<annotation class="ORG"/> and an epidemiologist at the University of Bern<annotation class="ORG"/>.
