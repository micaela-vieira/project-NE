Publishing 	 VBG
an 	 DT

this 	 DT

350 	 CD

we 	 PRP
moved 	 VBD

the 	 DT
age 	 NN

The 	 DT

a 	 DT

There 	 EX

You 	 PRP

all 	 PDT

We 	 PRP

That 	 DT

the 	 DT

If 	 IN

then 	 RB
we 	 PRP

conclude 	 VB
an 	 DT

 	 _SP
The 	 DT
whole 	 JJ

The 	 DT
many 	 JJ
different 	 JJ

it 	 PRP

 	 _SP
That 	 DT

it 	 PRP

 	 _SP
A 	 DT

it 	 PRP

It 	 PRP

come 	 VB

the 	 DT

If 	 IN

the 	 DT

it 	 PRP

the 	 DT

Such 	 PDT
a 	 DT

 	 _SP
Have 	 VBP

 	 _SP
Yes 	 UH

Together 	 RB

the 	 DT
famous 	 JJ
mathematician 	 NN
Timothy 	 NNP
Gowers 	 NNPS

the 	 DT

It 	 PRP

a 	 DT

The 	 DT
editorial 	 NN

concentrate 	 VB

the 	 DT

The 	 DT

to 	 IN
about 	 IN
ten 	 CD

So 	 RB
it 	 PRP
's 	 VBZ
a 	 DT
hundred 	 CD

a 	 DT

cheaper 	 JJR

 	 _SP

 	 _SP
To 	 TO

we 	 PRP

more 	 RBR

In 	 IN

, 	 ,
you 	 PRP
only 	 RB

a 	 DT
small 	 JJ

because 	 IN
you 	 PRP

both 	 DT

the 	 DT

such 	 JJ

A 	 DT
bit 	 NN
too 	 RB
much 	 JJ

The 	 DT

even 	 RB

This 	 DT

a 	 DT

That 	 DT
